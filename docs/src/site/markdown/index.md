<head><title>Welcome to Apache TEZ&reg;</title></head>

Introduction
------------

The Apache TEZ&reg; project is aimed at building an application framework
which allows for a complex directed-acyclic-graph of tasks for processing
data. It is currently built atop
[Apache Hadoop YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html).

The 2 main design themes for Tez are:

-   **Empowering end users by:**
    -   Expressive dataflow definition APIs
    -   Flexible Input-Processor-Output runtime model
    -   Data type agnostic
    -   Simplifying deployment
-   **Execution Performance**
    -   Performance gains over Map Reduce
    -   Optimal resource management
    -   Plan reconfiguration at runtime
    -   Dynamic physical data flow decisions

By allowing projects like Apache Hive and Apache Pig to run a complex
DAG of tasks, Tez can be used to process data, that earlier took
multiple MR jobs, now in a single Tez job as shown below.
