# Tez-ui

The Tez UI is an ember based web-app that provides visualization of Tez applications running on the Apache Hadoop YARN framework.

For more information on Tez and the Tez UI - Check the [Tez homepage](http://tez.apache.org/ "Apache Tez Homepage").

## Configurations

### In tez-site.xml
  * `tez.runtime.convert.user-payload.to.history-text` : Should be enabled to get the configuration options in. If enabled, the config options are set as userpayload per input/output.

### In yarn-site.xml
  * `yarn.timeline-service.http-cross-origin.enabled` : Enable CORS in timeline.
  * `yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled` : Enable generic history service in timeline server
  * `yarn.timeline-service.enabled` : Enabled the timeline server for logging details
  * `yarn.timeline-service.webapp.address` : Value must be the IP:PORT on which timeline server is running

### In configs.js
  This environment configuration file can be found at `./src/main/webapp/config/configs.js`

  * `ENV.hosts.timeline` : Timeline Server Address. By default TEZ UI looks for timeline server at http://localhost:8188.
  * `ENV.hosts.rm` : Resource Manager Address. By default RM REST APIs are expected to be at http://localhost:8088.
  * `ENV.hosts.rmProxy` : This is options. Value configured as RM host will be taken as proxy address by default. Use this configuration when RM web proxy is configured at a different address than RM.
  * `ENV.timeZone` : Time Zone in which dates are displayed in the UI. If not set, local time zone will be used. Refer http://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/ for valid entries.

## Package & deploy

### Get war package
  * Tez UI is distributed as a war package.
  * To build & package UI without running test cases, run `mvn clean package -DskipTests` in this directory.
  * This would give you a war file in `./target`.
  * UI build is part of tez build, refer BUILDING.txt for more info.

### Using UI war
##### Remotely:
  Use webfront tomcat manager to upload & deploy your war remotely.
##### Manually:
  The war can be added to any tomcat instance.
  1. Remove any old deployments in `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps`
  2. Copy the war to `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps`
  3. Restart tomcat and the war will get deployed. The content of the war would be available in
     `$TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/tez-ui-[version]` directory.

## Development

All the following commands must be run inside `src/main/webapp`.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) v0.21.3
* Install [Bower](http://bower.io/) v1.7.7
* Install all dependencies by running `yarn install` & `bower install`

### Running UI

* `yarn start`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Running Tests

* `yarn test`

### Building

* `yarn run build` (production)
* Files would be stored in "dist/"

### Adding new dependencies

**Warning: Do not edit the _package.json_ or _bower.json_ files manually. This could make them out-of-sync with the respective lock or shrinkwrap files.**

Tez UI has replaced NPM with Yarn package manager. And hence Yarn would be used to manage dependencies defined in package.json.

* Please use the Yarn and Bower command-line tools to add new dependencies. And the tool version must be same as those defined in Prerequisites section.
* Once any dependency is added:
  *  If it's in package.json. Make sure that the respective, and only those changes are reflected in yarn.lock file.
  *  If it's in bower.json. Make sure that the respective, and only those changes are reflected in bower-shrinkwrap.json file.
* Commands to add using CLI tools:
  * Yarn: yarn add [package-name]
  * Bower: bower install --save [package-name]

### Adding new routes (pages), controllers, components etc.

* Use ember-cli blueprint generator - [Ember CLI](http://ember-cli.com/extending/#generators-and-blueprints)
