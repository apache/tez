 * A simple shared object registry to cache objects in the memory of the

 * improvements. The cached objects have different life-cycles. If a task adds
 * an object to the cache with Vertex life-cycle then that object is in the
 * cache while the Vertex (to which the task belongs) is running. DAG life-cycle
 * is while the DAG (to which that task belongs) is running. Session life-cycle
 * is while the session (to which that task belongs) is running. <br>
