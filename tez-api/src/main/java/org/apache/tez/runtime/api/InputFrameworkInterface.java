 * Represents an input through which a TezProcessor receives data on an edge.

 *
 * During initialization, Inputs must specify an initial memory requirement via
 * {@link InputContext}.requestInitialMemory
 * <p/>
 *
 *
 * Inputs must also inform the framework once they are ready to be consumed.
 * This typically means that the Processor will not block when reading from the
 * corresponding Input. This is done via {@link InputContext}.inputIsReady.
 * Inputs choose the policy on when they are ready.
